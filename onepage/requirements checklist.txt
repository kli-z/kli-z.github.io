+ Done, or don't expect to encounter a situation where this would change
- Not done
= In progress
? Rule requires an optional(?) element be present

-   Modular Scale

+   Color Palette

-   Gridline

+   Project must be built with only one valid well-formed HTML file, one valid CSS file, and one JavaScript file.

+   All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF)

+   Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf HTML or CSS frameworks)

+   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries

+   Only structural, semantic uses of HTML elements and attributes. Absolutely no table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout.

+   At least three HTML form elements, written in conjunction with <label> tags and the for attribute

?   Semantically structured text-based HTML content to accompany any media elements (image, audio, video)

+   CSS file should open with a set of reset styles (such as the minified Eric Meyer resets from class demos)

=   Only relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS; no px, pt, or other absolute units allowed

-   Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for larger screens

=   JavaScript that throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively (no JavaScript event attributes in your HTML, in other words; attach events to any elements requiring interaction)

=   JavaScript that uses function closures and other techniques to avoid polluting the global window namespace

=   JavaScript that uses only asynchronous methods and callbacks

+   A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make

+   Use of the command-line Git program on your computer; no commits made through the GitHub web interface (this isnâ€™t kindergarten)

+   GitHub repository must contain only the files and commits from this project
